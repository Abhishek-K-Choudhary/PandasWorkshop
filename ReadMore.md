- First, do the homework and discuss it on our [community forums](https://discourse.univ.ai). Feel free to ask any and all questions there.
- If you are confused about anything related to Pandas, check out the [official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html#api)
- Pandas also has a comprehensive [user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) to help you learn through various topics.
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/) (book by Wes McKinney - creator of Pandas)
- If you would like to learn all aspects of Python (and some math and stats) needed to do AI, our [PyDS](https://welcome.univ.ai/courses/pyds/) course is great!
- [Jake Vanderplas's Book](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is a great resource.
